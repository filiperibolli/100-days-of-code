# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: March 6th, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Started prototyping the app's layout.

**Thoughts:** Getting along with the template wasn't big deal since it already came developed under Angular. Still need to match the template's colors with my personal logo

### Day 2: March 7th, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Tried to add Material Datepicker lib

**Thoughts:** I struggled with including some 3rd parties' lib such as Material Design 2 (Datepicker). Maybe tomorrow I'll fix it or drop it

### Day 3: March 9th, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Fixed MD2 Datepicker

**Thoughts:** After some research, I found out it was as easy as including Angular's `FormsModule` to my module. Also I customized the datepicker to show only the button and open it through it.

### Day 4: March 13th, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Added services to communicate with the API

**Thoughts:** I thought that would be much harder to create a form-submit feature, but Angular really makes it easy

### Day 5: March 14th, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Rendered the timeline based on a service

**Thoughts:** I'm mocking the stories since I don't have the API up and running yet. Maybe tomorrow will have my hands on it. However, mocking data is usefull to check if your Angular code is right. Still need to implement automated tests

### Day 6: March 15th, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Changed theme's color and listed all my Github repos

**Thoughts:** Today I created a service, changed template's theme and included a 3rd party library all on my own. Previously, It took me a whole week and several hours of watching tutorials to accomplish it all. Tomorrow I'll start creating the backend API.
