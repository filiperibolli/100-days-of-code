# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: March 6th, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Started prototyping the app's layout.

**Thoughts:** Getting along with the template wasn't big deal since it already came developed under Angular. Still need to match the template's colors with my personal logo

### Day 2: March 7th, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Tried to add Material Datepicker lib

**Thoughts:** I struggled with including some 3rd parties' lib such as Material Design 2 (Datepicker). Maybe tomorrow I'll fix it or drop it

### Day 3: March 9th, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Fixed MD2 Datepicker

**Thoughts:** After some research, I found out it was as easy as including Angular's `FormsModule` to my module. Also I customized the datepicker to show only the button and open it through it.

### Day 4: March 13th, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Added services to communicate with the API

**Thoughts:** I thought that would be much harder to create a form-submit feature, but Angular really makes it easy
