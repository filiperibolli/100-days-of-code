# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: March 6th, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Started prototyping the app's layout. Tried to add Material Datepicker lib

**Thoughts:** Getting along with the template wasn't big deal since it already came developed under Angular, but I struggled with including some 3rd parties' lib such as Material Design 2 (Datepicker). Maybe tomorrow I'll fix it or drop it. Still need to match the template's colors with my personal logo
