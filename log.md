# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: March 7th, 2019

**Today's Progress**: I started the application menu, set springMVC with Bootstrap.

**Thoughts:** It was not difficult to adjust the environment and code the menu, since I have a wide experience with the technologies used, the biggest challenge will be BigData.

### Day 2: March 8th, 2019

**Today's Progress**: I concluded the robot transation logs

**Thoughts:** I effectively ended the robot of creating transaction logs. I was very happy about how fast the progress is. I know the challenges will come, but with the technologies I master, I have no difficulty.
